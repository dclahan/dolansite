# dolansite
This is the code for my personal website - its pretty basic html/css/js i didn't want to be bogged down by any crazy frameworks on this simple site thats mainly text.

## TODO:
- [ ] update bio and what im doing and stuff
- [ ] add better pages (imp pages you havent)
- [ ] add caption under profile photo that says "if u dont like my face refresh the page"
